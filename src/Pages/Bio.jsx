        <p>
          I love finding unique and creative ways to curate the stories around me into visual narratives.
          Every element of photography is centered around people. Even when there is no human to be seen,
          the image itself is designed to engage someone's eye. People are the focal point, and it's light that captures them.
          I process the world in pictures, understand life through the light that defines it, and speak through the lens of a camera.
